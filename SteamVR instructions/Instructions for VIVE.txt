For testing the Vive Controller with Meta 2 headset, you will need to run the script 'udp_emmiter.py' (on the folder 'triad_openvr-master').
This script is responsible to read the data from the Vive Controller and send it to Unity through a local UDP connection.
You need to update the config.json file so it will contain the serial number of the controller you want to track.
One way of getting the serial of the controllers is deleting (or renaming or moving to another folder) the config.json file and running the
controller_test.py script while the desired controller is connected to the SteamVR application. The script shall print the info
of the identified controller. Once you have the serial number, you can edit the config.json file and update its info. After that,
you still need to update the udp_emitter.py file so it will search for the desired controller data (update the value of the
'desiredController' variable).
