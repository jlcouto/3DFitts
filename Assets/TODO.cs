/* TODO LIST
 *
 * MAIN SCENE
 * x Automatically load values from current experiment configuration when returning from the experiment scenes
 * - Add button to increment session code?
 * - Button to connect to Meta2
 * - Button to calibrate Meta2 spatial position (to define where the experiments will take place in the real space)
 * - Buttons/indicators to check if the selected positioning method is working
 * - Buttons to calibrate the current positioning method
 * 
 * - Automatically calculate conversion of pixels/real screen size/virtual unity size?
 *   This way we can have the dimensions expressed in pixels for the 2D Mode.
 * 
 * 3D SCENE
 * - 
 * 
 * GENERAL
 * - Show screens always in fullscreen mode? Maximized mode? What's best?
 * x Unify 2D and 3D scenes
