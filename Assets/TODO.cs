/* TODO LIST
 * 
 * BUGS
 * - After calibrating or running tests with Leap Motion, the system stops working
 * - VIVE trigger button not working (probably due to change in selection to click up event)
 * 
 * MAIN SCENE
 * - Button to connect to Meta2 while in menu?
 * - Buttons/indicators to check if the selected positioning method is working
 * - Dialog instructing how to do the calibration process?
 * 
 * GENERAL
 * - Show screens always in fullscreen mode? Maximized mode? What's best? 
 * - Test data for normality?
 * - Toggle cursor visibility?
 * - Menu for configuring outliers filter?
 * - Menu to generate Fitts' Law from group of data?
 * 
 * DONE:
 * x Unify 2D and 3D scenes
 * x Export results in .csv
 * x Compute results considering outliers
 * x Allow easily merging different .csv results files
 * x Automatically calculate conversion of pixels/real screen size/virtual unity size?
 *   This way we can have the dimensions expressed in pixels for the 2D Mode.
 * x Allow entering dimension units in pixels or meters?
 * x Button to calibrate Meta2 spatial position (to define where the experiments will take place in the real space)
 * x Buttons to calibrate the current positioning method
 * x Automatically load values from current experiment configuration when returning from the experiment scenes
 * x Add button to increment session code? (added message box alerting results already exists)
